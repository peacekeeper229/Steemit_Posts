# Only two things to focus on when your writing on Steemit !  And It's not the drama listed below.....  

## Let me start off by saying there isn't a problem with Steemit.  There is a problem with what we expect to get from Steemit.     
* So you didn’t make $1000.00 or more on your article but other users did.  So What....   
* The bot made more in curation and on comments than I did. Who cares....
* The developers have friends and they make a lot of money from Up Votes. Big deal....
* Some famous person comes to Steemit and they get a fat paycheck. Why does that bother you....

## Improve on what you can change:
I went back and looked at all of my post over the last two months. The first thing I noticed is I didn't really write any good articles or stories. I just had random posts about steemit, posted some photos and videos, and had some short comments about issues I was having. My format was not that good and I wasn't using markdown code. After a few months here on Steemit and reading hundreds of articles you get a pretty good idea what looks good and what is easy to read. I have noticed there are a few authors that will give you legitimate feedback which is awesome. This is always welcome to me personally, especially if they had taken the time to comment on your post and give you some pointers. Then again, some people can't take criticism very well. If someone gives you negative feedback, just say thank you and try to learn from what they are saying. If you don't agree with them, just ignore them. Don't let it bother you, trust me it's OK, no big deal. They will forget about you within a few minutes of leaving your article. Don't feel like your obligated to show your worth to everyone else or impress someone with what you write. Yes, I know you are trying to get rewards and build a user base, but write because you enjoy it and write to express your feelings or thoughts.

Inner Critic | " You can do this " :-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
We can be are our own worst enemies, in other words don't let your inner critic control you, this will lead to you second guessing yourself and sabotaging your own writing if that makes sense. Rememberyou have your own strengths and they are different than everyone else. | ![](http://www.steem101.com/goodbad.jpg)


Always start off by writing your ideas on paper. This was a great practice, especially for me since I can't remember what I had for dinner last night. Think of the positive things about your life, your family or your work. Use your personal skill sets and your life experience to contribute to your writings. I have seen several users say "I can't think of anything to write about" or "I haven't done anything to write about". If you sit down with a notebook and list your hobbies, something you like to do in your free time or on weekends, something that had happen to you on a past trip or while in college, or even at your place of employment. You start brainstorming about anything and everything. Later you can mark things or add things to your list.
